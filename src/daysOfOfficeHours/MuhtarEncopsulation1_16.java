    /**
     * encopsulation:
     * information(data) hidded private secretly
     * make sure !! the data is hiding it should not visible with any classes.no access modifiyer
     * access modifiyer job is access control.how many access modify we have:public, default, private and protect
     * they decided visibelaty future what they have.
     * in order the data data must be private access modifiyer. not visible outside classes only visible ot=r accesseble
     * within the class. as soon as you give the private the data will be no longer visible the outside of the classes.
     * only can visible class access it.
     * think about it; password or user name(confidantial )data to make sure avaliablety. I should be able to outside of
     * data when you have user name and password your shuld be reab=d the sessetive data ,
     * accessible the outside classes is there any possible to read the data yes!!wuth getter and setter!!
     * getter and setter can be declear?getter and setter has to be in public!!!!! for reading sesetively!!
     * userInfo class I created for that class variable data are
     * instance variable:
     * declared inside(within) the class ,outside anymethods blocks
     * belong to the object you create class.can we create multiple object from a class?
     *yes we can..if we create hundres of objects from a class each objects they have own copy of instance variable
     * constructuor: every class must have.if you don't create one then the compiler will create defaul (no-arg)
     * constructor.
     * getter method disayned read only.this si istance method only. what is funcionalty
     * getter it returns the value of the private data.return type of method must MATCH WITH private data-type
     * setter(modify) instance method does not return anything return type must be void
     * passes a parameter ( like int string that mean passes parameter!!)
     *this :refers to object instance
     * this. : used to call instance variable and instance method
     *how do we declare the constructor?
     * you can only give the access modifier and class name. to gice the class name is
     * mandatory.you can give the statement ; if you give the statement it only when you created the object
     *
